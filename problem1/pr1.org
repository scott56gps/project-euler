* Problem 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get
3,5,6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

** Issues to Solve
*** What is a number square?
A number square is a collection of multiples of the number N laid out in an NxN
grid.
*** How do I make a number square?
The multiples of N are laid out such that, for a given row, a number is output
as determined by the following formula:

| (N*1)+0*10 | N*2... | N*3... |
| (N*1)+1*10 | N*2... | N*3... |
| (N*1)+2*10 | N*2... | N*3... |
